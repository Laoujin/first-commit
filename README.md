Batch script to launch games.

My sister reminded me that I created these, I completely forgot but yeah, here they are!  

The Games
---------

The launcher could start these games:

- ARK2: A breakout game with level builder!
- Prince: The one and only (+ with `megahit`)
- SPEL-1: FriendlyWare PC Arcade games



I found some screenshots for much nostalgia:
- [1980 Games](80s/README.md)
- [1990 Games](90s/README.md)


FAQ
----

Q: I see weird ï¿½ signs in the source code!?  
A: For full viewing pleasure, please open the batch files in `CP437`.
